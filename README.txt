Welcome to my text editor!!

----------------------------------------------

This editor was built using Java 8 and the built-in JavaFX GUI, and is styled with CSS.
It has several functions that are geared towards ease of use, such as a file opener, file saver,and font options and sizing.

Future iterations of this will likely involve the addition of a word counter and theme selection.

----------------------------------------------

This application is not currently packaged as an executable, but should be able to run from any editor that supports Java.
Thank you in advance for using this editor!
